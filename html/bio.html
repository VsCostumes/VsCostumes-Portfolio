She worked in Rome with an amateur theatre company as assistant director, organising wardrobe and alterations and sourcing props, and on a short film helping with scenography.<br/>
Having moved to London she attended courses at Central Saint Martins in order to improve her making and feed her passion for costumes for performance.
After working as a graphic and web designer, Valeria decided to turn her passion into a career, graduating from Royal Central School of Speech and Drama with a first class BA in Theatre Practice Costume Construction and has since gained experience as a costume maker, standby, buyer and costume supervisor assistant for a variety of movies, theatres and operas. 
 
<br/><br/>
She has worked as assistant supervisor at Royal Opera House and English National Opera on numerous productions, and as a maker on a variety of movies such as Disney's "Cinderella" and "Beauty and the Beast", Lucas Film's "Andor", Netflix "3 body problem" and many more.<br/><br/>
Her skills include:
dressmaking, 
tailoring, 
latex clothing, 
corsetry and undergarments, 
period and modern wear, 
pattern cutting, 
draping, basic millinery, 
assistant supervisor,
sourcing and buying, Photoshop, Illustrator, Word and Excel.
<br/><br/>
Valeria speaks fluent English and Italian understands some basic Spanish and has a JLPTN5 certificate in Japanese.
